In order to generate the trip rates, three additional files are required:
- *DefTraveller.csv*
- *IBETAhsr_NTEM7.2_NEW.csv*
- *IRhomdhsr_NTEM7.2_NEW.csv*

By default these are assumed to be in a folder called "Input" located alongside `extract_trip_rates.py`. These files are not included within this repository due to licensing issues, but may be made available on request.
